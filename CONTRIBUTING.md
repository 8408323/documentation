# Contributing

Please observe our contribution guidelines before creating an issue or pull request.

**Please note that the issue tracker on this repository is for issues with *the contents of the documentation*, not support queries. Please post support queries in the [forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/).**

When creating an issue:

- Please explain the issue as clearly as possible
- Please include a link to the page(s) your issue relates to
- Please use [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format your issue, particularly when including blocks of code

When creating a pull request:

- With the exception of typos and spelling mistakes (feel free to fix these and they'll be merged if they accord with our in-house style guide), always open an issue first. This will allow us to determine whether or not the change should take place. Explain your issue, and we will discuss it with you. If we agree the change is necessary we will mark it as TODO and will fix it when we get a chance, or we will allow a member of the community to supply the change with a pull request.
- Note that this documentation is intended to be a short and concise set of helpful resources aimed at the majority of users. We will only feature our recommended distribution, Raspbian, in detail; and in order to keep the documentation manageable we will not accept additions covering alternative distributions.

There is a short tutorial on making changes using Github [here](using-github.md).

**Please be aware we are not able to deal with all issues and pull requests immediately, so please have patience.**
